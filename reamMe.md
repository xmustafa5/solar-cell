It appears that the provided sources do not contain accessible information regarding the minimum peak sun-hours per day in Iraq for all months. However, based on general knowledge about solar irradiance and the geographical location of Iraq, we can provide a rough estimate.

Iraq, being located in the Middle East, experiences a high amount of solar irradiance throughout the year due to its latitude and proximity to the equator. The minimum peak sun-hours per day can vary significantly depending on the month, with the highest values occurring in the summer months (June to August) and the lowest in the winter months (December to February).

Summer (June to August): These months typically have the highest solar irradiance, with peak sun-hours potentially reaching up to 5-6 hours per day.
Winter (December to February): During these months, sun-hours decrease, with peak sun-hours possibly averaging around 2-3 hours per day.
It's important to note that these are rough estimates and actual values can vary based on specific location within Iraq, altitude, and atmospheric conditions. For precise figures, consulting local meteorological data or solar radiation databases would be necessary.
